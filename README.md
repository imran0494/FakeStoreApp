## 🔄 App Flow

```
App Launch
    ↓
checkAuthStatus() — SecureStore mein token check
    ↓
Token found → Home Screen (Products)
Token not found → Login Screen
    ↓
Login → POST /auth/login → Token saved in SecureStore
    ↓
Home Screen → GET /products → Redux state → FlatList grid
    ↓
Product tap → GET /products/:id → Product Detail Screen
    ↓
Logout → Tokens cleared → Back to Login Screen
```

## 🔑 Authentication & Token Management

- **Access Token** — Stored securely using `expo-secure-store`. Attached to every API request via Axios request interceptor (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
- **Refresh Token** — Also stored in SecureStore. Used to silently obtain a new access token when a `401 Unauthorized` response is received, without logging the user out.
- **Auto Token Refresh** — Implemented via Axios response interceptor. On 401, a new token is fetched automatically and the original request is retried. A `_retry` flag prevents infinite retry loops.
- **Persistent Session** — On app relaunch, token is read from SecureStore so the user doesn't need to login again.

> **Note:** Expo SecureStore is used instead of AsyncStorage for enhanced security. On Android it uses the Android Keystore system, and on iOS it uses the Keychain — both provide hardware-level encryption.

## 🔍 Search

- Search is implemented **client-side** on the Redux product list — no additional API calls are made.
- Uses word-boundary matching (`startsWith`) combined with substring matching for queries of 3+ characters.
- Search state is managed in Redux so it persists across re-renders.

```
"men"  → matches "Men's Clothing" ✅, skips "Women's" ✅
"jew"  → matches "Jewellery" ✅
"je"   → matches any word starting with "je" ✅
```

## 🌐 API Reference

**Base URL:** `https://fakestoreapi.com`

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/auth/login` | POST | Login and get access token |
| `/products` | GET | Fetch all products |
| `/products/:id` | GET | Fetch single product by ID |

---

## 📝 Notes

- Fake Store API does not provide a dedicated `/auth/refresh` endpoint. Token refresh is simulated by re-calling `/auth/login`. In a production app, a proper refresh token endpoint would be used — only the refresh token would be sent, with no password required.
- Username is persisted in SecureStore to support dynamic token refresh for any logged-in user. Password is never stored — this follows standard security best practices.
